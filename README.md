# MNIST Digit Classification Project

## Information

This is my final project at Dongseo University during my third semester.

The goal of the project is to classify the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits using advanced convolutional neural networks.

The project is divided into three parts: data preprocessing, model definition, and model evaluation.

The project is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn, tensorflow library.
